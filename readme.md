# WebdriverJS Example
WebdriverJS will be deprecating their promise manager in the future, and intend to make use of Node's `async` and `await` architecture (available in Node v7.6+). This project includes examples of using WebdriverJS with this new architecture.

It also uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) for a test runner, 'cause it's fun!

## Requirements
- Node js 7.6+

## Running
- install dependencies: `npm install`
- run tests: `npm test`

## Links
- [WebdriverJS API](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index.html)
